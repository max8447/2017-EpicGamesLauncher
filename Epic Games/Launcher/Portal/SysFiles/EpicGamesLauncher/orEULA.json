<EULA.Header>7.	Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</>  

<EULA.Header>The Software (including any Premium Features) is provided on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis, \"with all faults\" and without warranty of any kind.  Epic, its licensors, and its and their affiliates disclaim all warranties, conditions, common law duties, and representations (express, implied, oral, and written) with respect to the Software including without limitation all express, implied, and statutory warranties and conditions of any kind, such as title, non-interference with your enjoyment, authority, non-infringement, merchantability, fitness or suitability for any purpose (whether or not Epic knows or has reason to know of any such purpose), system integration, accuracy or completeness, results, reasonable care, workmanlike effort, lack of negligence, and lack of viruses, whether alleged to arise under law, by reason of custom or usage in the trade, or by course of dealing.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Epic, its licensors, and its and their affiliates make no warranty that (1) the Software will operate properly, (2) that the Software will meet your requirements, (3) that the operation of the Software will be uninterrupted, bug free, or error free in any or all circumstances, or (4) that any defects in the Software can or will be corrected.  Any warranty against infringement that may be provided in Section 2-312 of the Uniform Commercial Code or in any other comparable statute is expressly disclaimed.  Epic, its licensors, and its and their affiliates do not guarantee continuous, error-free, virus-free, or secure operation of or access to the Software.  This paragraph will apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</>
 
<EULA.Header>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither Epic, nor its licensors, nor its or their affiliates, nor any of Epic's service providers (collectively, the \"Epic Parties\"), shall be liable in any way for any loss of profits or any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Software (including any Premium Features), even in the event of an Epic Party's fault, tort (including negligence), strict liability, indemnity, product liability, breach of contract, breach of warranty, or otherwise and even if an Epic Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Further, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability of the Epic Parties arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Software (including any Premium Features) will not exceed the total amounts you have paid (if any) to Epic for the Software or Premium Content during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the events giving rise to such liability. These limitations and exclusions regarding damages apply even if any remedy fails to provide adequate compensation.</>

<EULA.Header>Notwithstanding the foregoing, some countries, states, provinces or other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability as stated above, so the above terms may not apply to you. Instead, in such jurisdictions, the foregoing exclusions and limitations shall apply only to the extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions. Also, you may have additional legal rights in your jurisdiction, and nothing in this Agreement will prejudice the statutory rights that you may have as a consumer of the Software.</>

You agree to reimburse Epic on demand for any defense costs incurred by Epic and any payments made or loss suffered by Epic, whether in a court judgment or settlement, based on any matter covered by this Section 8.

If you are prohibited by law from entering into the indemnification obligation above, then you assume, to the extent permitted by law, all liability for all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys' fees, costs and expert witnesses' fees) that are the stated subject matter of the indemnification obligation above.
