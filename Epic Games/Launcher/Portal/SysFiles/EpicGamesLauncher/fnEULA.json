<EULA.Header>3.	Updates and Patches</>

Epic may provide patches, updates, or upgrades to the Software that must be installed in order for you to continue to use the Software or Services.  Epic may update the Software remotely without notifying you, and you hereby consent to Epic applying patches, updates, and upgrades.  Epic may modify, suspend, discontinue, substitute, replace, or limit your access to any aspect of the Software or Services at any time.  You acknowledge that your use of the Software or Services does not confer on you any interest, monetary or otherwise, in any aspect or feature of the Software or Services, including but not limited to any in-game rewards, achievements, character levels, Game Currency, or Content.  You also acknowledge that any character data, game progress, game customization or other data related to your use of the Software or Services may cease to be available to you at any time without notice from Epic, including without limitation after a patch, update, or upgrade is applied by Epic.  Epic does not have any support obligations with respect to the Software or Services.  

<EULA.Header>4.	Game Currency and Content</>

Epic may offer you the ability to acquire licenses to in-game currency (\"<EULA.Highlight>Game Currency</>\") or Content, such as by: (a) purchasing a limited license to use Game Currency for a fee (\"<EULA.Highlight>Purchased Game Currency</>\"), (b) earning a limited license to use Game Currency by performing or accomplishing specific tasks in the Software, or (c) purchasing for a fee, exchanging Game Currency for, or earning a limited license to use Content.  Also, Epic may facilitate the exchange of certain Content through the Software, in some cases for a fee.  You may only use such Game Currency or Content if you pay the associated fee (if any).  When you earn or pay the fee to obtain such Game Currency or Content, you are obtaining or purchasing from Epic the right to have your License include such Game Currency or Content.  Regardless of any references Epic may make outside this Agreement to purchasing or selling Game Currency or Content, both Game Currency and Content are licensed, not sold, to you under the License.  Use of an Epic Account Balance to purchase Game Currency or Content is subject to Epic's Terms of Service.

Game Currency may only be redeemed for Content or other gameplay features for use within the Software, and neither Game Currency nor Content are redeemable for money or monetary value from Epic or any other person, except as otherwise required by applicable law.  Game Currency and Content do not have an equivalent value in real currency and do not act as a substitute for real currency.  Neither Epic nor any other person or entity has any obligation to exchange Game Currency or Content for anything of value, including, but not limited to, real currency.  You agree that Epic may engage in actions that may impact the perceived value or purchase price, if applicable, of Game Currency and Content at any time, except as prohibited by applicable law. 

All purchases of Purchased Game Currency and Content are final and are not refundable, transferable, or exchangeable under any circumstances, except as otherwise required by applicable law.  Epic, in its sole discretion, may impose limits on the amount of Game Currency or Content that may be purchased, earned, accumulated, redeemed or otherwise used. 

Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, Epic, in its sole discretion, has the absolute right to manage, modify, substitute, replace, suspend, cancel or eliminate Game Currency or Content, including your ability to access or use Game Currency or Content, without notice or liability to you.  However, so long as the Software is still being operated in your territory, Epic will make commercially reasonable efforts to replace any modified, suspended, cancelled, or eliminated Game Currency or Content with Game Currency or Content of the similar or greater value (as reasonably determined by Epic).  You may not transfer, sell, gift, exchange, trade, lease, sublicense, or rent Game Currency or Content except within the Software and as expressly permitted by Epic.  Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, Epic reserves and retains all rights, title, and interest in and to the Game Currency and Content.  The license to Game Currency and Content under the License will terminate upon termination of the License and as otherwise provided herein.

When you provide payment information to Epic or its authorized processor, you represent that you are an authorized user of the payment card, PIN, key, account or other payment method specified by you, and you authorize Epic to charge such payment method for the full amount of the transaction.


<EULA.Header>5.	Confidentiality</>

<EULA.Header>6.	Feedback</>

If you provide Epic with any Feedback, you hereby assign to Epic all right, title, and interest (including all copyright, patent, and other intellectual property rights) in that Feedback for all current and future methods and forms of exploitation in any country.

If any such rights may not be assigned or licensed under applicable law (such as moral and other personal rights), you hereby waive and agree not to assert all such rights.  You understand and agree that Epic is not required to make any use of any Feedback that you provide.  You agree that if Epic makes use of your Feedback, Epic is not required to credit or compensate you for your contribution. You represent and warrant that you have sufficient rights in any Feedback that you provide to Epic to grant Epic and other affected parties the rights described above.  This includes but is not limited to intellectual property rights and other proprietary or personal rights.

This paragraph will apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</>

<EULA.Header>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither Epic, its licensors, nor its or their affiliates, nor any of Epic's service providers (collectively, the \"Epic Parties\"), shall be liable in any way for any loss of profits or any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Software (including any Game Currency or Content) or Services, or the delay or inability to use or lack of functionality of the Software or Services, even in the event of an Epic Party's fault, tort (including negligence), strict liability, indemnity, product liability, breach of contract, breach of warranty, or otherwise and even if an Epic Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  Further, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability of the Epic Parties arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Software (including any Game Currency or Content) or Services will not exceed the total amounts you have paid (if any) to Epic under this Agreement during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the events giving rise to such liability.  These limitations and exclusions regarding damages apply even if any remedy fails to provide adequate compensation.</>

<EULA.Header>Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, the liability of the Epic Parties shall be limited to the full extent permitted by law.</>

<EULA.Header>9.	Indemnity</>  

You agree to indemnify, pay the defense costs of, and hold Epic, its licensors, its and their affiliates, and its and their employees, officers, directors, agents, contractors, and other representatives harmless from all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys' fees, costs, and expert witnesses' fees) that arise from or in connection with (a) any claim that, if true, would constitute a breach by you of this Agreement or negligence by you, or (b) any act or omission by you in using the Software (including any Game Currency or Content) or Services.  You agree to reimburse Epic on demand for any defense costs incurred by Epic and any payments made or loss suffered by Epic, whether in a court judgment or settlement, based on any matter covered by this Section 9.

If you are prohibited by law from entering into the indemnification obligation above, then you assume, to the extent permitted by law, all liability for all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys' fees, costs and expert witnesses' fees) that are the stated subject matter of the indemnification obligation above.
